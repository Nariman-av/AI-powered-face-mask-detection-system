# AI-Powered Face Mask Detection System

**Overview:**

This project presents a sophisticated face mask detection system designed to accurately identify whether individuals are wearing face masks. The system is built upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Python, utilizing TensorFlow for model training and validation. The implementation of data preprocessing techniques, including image resizing and normalization, ensures consistent input shape and optimal performance.

The project features a custom CNN architecture with multiple layers for effective feature extraction and classification. The model is trained and tested on a dataset of images featuring individuals with and without masks, resulting in a high degree of accuracy in mask detection.
